                    Hello, my name is Chris. I spent 8 years working for one of the countryâ€™s leading lawn care companies
                    before setting up CMF Garden services.
                    <br /><br />

                    The aim of CMF Garden Services is to provide a reliable and
                    friendly high quality garden maintenance service to the local community.
                    <br /><br />

                    I am fully insured and have
                    PA1 and PA6 licences so you can book my services with peace of mind. I cover all areas between the
                    Solihull area and the Stratford upon Avon area.
