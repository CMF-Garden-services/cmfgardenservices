            Hello, my name is Chris. I spent 8 years working for one of the countryâ€™s leading lawn care companies
before setting up CMF Garden services. 
<br/><br/>

The aim of CMF Garden Services is to provide a reliable and
friendly high quality garden maintenance service to the local community. 
<br/><br/>

I am fully insured and have
PA1 and PA6 licences so you can book my services with peace of mind. I cover all areas between the
Solihull area and the Stratford upon Avon area.
